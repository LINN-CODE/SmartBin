# Smart Bin Project

A Smart Bin system developed using Raspberry Pi and IoT technologies to encourage efficient waste management. This project includes features such as automatic lid opening, waste level monitoring, and real-time notifications.

## Overview

The **Smart Bin Project** is an IoT-based waste management system designed to:
1. Automate the opening and closing of the bin using motion sensors.
2. Monitor the waste level using ultrasonic sensors.
3. Send notifications or alerts when the bin is full or needs maintenance.
